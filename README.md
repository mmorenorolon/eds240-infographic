## Project Description

This repository supports an infographic project that explores how different storm events affect communities across Puerto Rico. Using the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Storm Events Database, the project analyzes patterns in storm impacts, from property damage to human injuries, to better understand which hazards pose the greatest risks. Together, these analyses aim to provide a clear, data‑driven picture of storm impacts in Puerto Rico and contribute to understanding the underlying risks associated with climate vulnerability and to informing future resilience planning.
